 * Follows the Adam reference shape: every chapter has 4–8 real narrative
 * paragraphs and a non-empty `sources` array. Qur'an anchors come only from
 * the verified verses (9:114, 2:127); other events are anchored to Ibn Kathir's
 * Tafsir / Qasas at book level with `needsVerification: true`, or to a hadith
 * in Sahih al-Bukhari / Sahih Muslim that the author is confident in.
 *
 * `ur` is empty except for `summary`: readers see the English fallback until
 * careful Urdu translations are added in a later pass.
