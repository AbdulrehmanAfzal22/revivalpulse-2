 *
 * Citation discipline for Sahabah content: Hadith/Seerah sourced ONLY. No
 * Quran-narrated "personal" events are used as sources here — everything is
 * anchored to authentic hadith or an established Seerah work. Where a
 * specific authentic narration could not be confidently verified while
 * writing, the reference is marked `needsVerification: true` rather than
 * guessing a number.
 *
 * `ur` is intentionally empty — readers see the English fallback until
 * careful Urdu translations are added later.
 *
 * Review sign-off: single-reviewer (site owner). Sources get `reviewed: true`
 * + `reviewedBy`/`reviewedDate` in batches; confirm-read sign-off, not
 * scholarly/ijazah certification.
